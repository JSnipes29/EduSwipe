## EduSwipe
### About
EduSwipe is an education trivia game where users can compete against their friends in a real-time battle of the wits!

### How to Play
To play users must install the app on an Android device and press the play button. Then they must wait for another play to join. When the game starts players will
see a card in the middle with a question and four choices to the top, left, right, and bottom. Players must swipe the card to the correct choice before the other player does.
If the player answers correctly they earn 10 points. However, if they choose wrongly they lose 10 points.
